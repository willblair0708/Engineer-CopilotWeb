1. In electric motors, torque (also known as the moment of force) is a fundamental concept. While the specifics haven't been given in the provided text, torque typically refers to the measure of the force that causes an object to rotate. It is vital in determining the motor's ability to perform work. 

2. Selecting an electric motor for industrial applications requires considering parameters like the required torques, the effect of load inertia, the need for speed control, environmental exposure conditions, the altitude where the motor will be installed, and the temperature of the cooling medium.

3. Squirrel cage asynchronous motors are widely used in various industrial applications, especially in challenging settings like steel plants, mines, pulp, and paper industries, sanitation, chemical and petrochemical areas, and cement plants. It is preferred due to its efficiency, durability, and lower maintenance costs.

4. The effect of load inertia and speed control requirements are critical factors that can influence motor performance. However, no specific details or examples have been given in the provided context.

5. The performance and life span of a machine can be significantly impacted by exposure to various environmental factors. For example, motors can suffer from factors such as pollution, excess moisture, and aggressive environments, which can degrade materials, cause failures due to dirt or particles ingress, or exacerbate wear and tear.

6. Factors such as altitude and cooling medium temperature are crucial in the selection of electric motors. High altitude could lead to thinner air impacting the cooling efficiency and potentially leading to overheating, while the cooling medium temperature can drastically affect the motor's performance and life span. 

7. Brake motors typically find use in applications that require rapid and precise stopping or applications that need to prevent the motor from moving when powered off. However, the context provided does not offer specific benefits associated with their application.

8. The use of frequency inverters with electric motors is regulated by certain norms to ensure safety and effective operation, although the specific regulation details are not shared in the context.

9. Ambient temperature can significantly affect the performance of electric motors. High ambient temperatures can lead to rapid overheating, reduced motor performance, and a shorter lifespan. 

10. For motors operating in temperatures below 20ºC, excessive condensation and contraction issues can be dealt with by implementing additional condensed water drains or heaters to reduce these issues.
