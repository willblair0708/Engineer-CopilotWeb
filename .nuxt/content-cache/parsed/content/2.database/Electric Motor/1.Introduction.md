As a global enterprise, WEG's commitment to excellence has made them a leading supplier of electronic products, encompassing numerous sectors. The motors they offer effectively convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, with their induction motors being particularly predominant due to their advantageous properties. Examples of these include low cost, ease of supply and distribution, clean handling, simple controls, and versatile construction adaptability. The motors also feature substantial energy-saving designs, reducing energy consumption significantly. Furthermore, they are optimized for various applications such as machine-tools, looms, packing machines, conveyor systems and more. Over five decades of growth and innovation have only amplified WEG’s dedication to providing comprehensive solutions and first-rate electric motors – a commitment that continues unfettered."}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"callout","props":{"type":"warning"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"template","props":{"v-slot:summary":""},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Purpose"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"template","props":{"v-slot:content":""},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The purpose of the motor product, as outlined in this specification guide by WEG, is to assist various industrial activities and contribute a significant portion to overall industry energy consumption. As a premier global supplier of electronic products, WEG prides itself on delivering motors that are tailored to their intended functions, boasting specific outputs and features. This specification document, produced by WEG, is designed both to inform and guide the manufacturing process. The goal of the spec sheet is to elucidate the details of the electric motors, providing an understanding of core concepts such as torque and power factor. It also informs the appropriate selection of motors based on parameters such as altitude, cooling medium temperature, and the environmental severity. The spec sheet aims to set international standards, ensuring WEG motors not only comply with but often exceed the requirements of the Design N standard. Ultimately, the spec sheet seeks to foster correct motor selection for each unique application, promoting efficiency and precision in various industries."}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"callout","props":{"type":"success"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"template","props":{"v-slot:summary":""},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Scope"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"template","props":{"v-slot:content":""},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"page_content='power and standard, some degrees of  protection cannot be applied because the mechanical  limitations of such motor might compromise its reliability.
